<HR><P>

<P>I am currently a Senior Lecturer and the Director of Undergraduate Admissions 
in the <A HREF="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/">School of Computer Science</A> 
at the <A HREF="http://www.bham.ac.uk/">University of Birmingham</A>. 
My academic career began as a Theoretical Physicist with a PhD on 
supergravity and other unified field theories from Southampton University, 
followed by a post-doctoral research position in the Mathematics Department
of Durham University working on superstring theory and quantum gravity. I then 
took a very early retirement to "travel the world".  Having seen enough of
the world (i.e., run out of money), I returned to academia three years later 
by retraining in Artificial Intelligence.  I then took up a series of research 
fellowships in the Psychology departments of Edinburgh University, Birkbeck College 
London and Reading University working on various computational modelling projects.
I moved to Birmingham and switched to Computer Science in 2001.</P> 

<P>My current research interests are mainly in the fields of Computational Intelligence, 
Cognitive Science, and Artificial Life, particularly those aspects involving Neural 
and Evolutionary Computation. Major projects in the past have involved models of 
brain damage (connectionist neuropsychology), language processing (reading, spelling, 
past tense production, lexical decision), adaptive control (particularly oculomotor 
control), the optimization of neural information processing architectures (including 
the emergence of modularity), and the formulation of more biologically realistic 
evolutionary computation algorithms. Recently I have been mainly working on simulating 
the evolution of neural systems: exploring the emergence of modularity, the optimization 
of learning algorithms, critical periods for learning, the interaction of learning and 
evolution, and aspects of Life History Evolution. I also have an ongoing interest in 
corpus derived semantic representations, and real-world optimization applications 
such as vehicle routing and bin packing.</P>

with an increasing number of them available online.

lucky enough to have me there.

lecture notes/handouts, project ideas, admin details, and such like.

<H3>Research Interests</H3>

<P>My current research interests cover a number of inter-related areas:
<li>Evolutionary computation - biologically inspired algorithms, the evolution of efficient
neural network systems, the Baldwin Effect, individual differences, variable neural
plasticity, incremental learning, and the evolution of modularity.
<li>Artificial Life - population based simulations, the interaction of lifetime learning 
and evolution, and aspects of life history evolution. 
<li>Representations of lexical semantics (working with Joe Levy, Roehampton University) - their 
extraction from large spoken and written corpora, their optimization, their validation, and their
use in models of natural language processing.
<li>Operations Research - real-world optimization applications such as vehicle routing and 
bin packing.
<li>Adaptable motor/sensor control systems - traditional and neural network models, 
optimization by learning and evolution, the interaction of learning and evolution, 
models of oculomotor control, and applications to robotics. 
<li>Connectionist neuropsychology - the simulation of brain damage using artificial neural
networks, the implications for the inference from double dissociation to modularity, and
the problems of small scale artefacts in such simulations.
<li>Models of reading, spelling and past tense acquisition - NETtalk style models that
do not require pre-processing of the training data, the incorporation of semantic routes,
and the simulation of developmental and acquired dyslexias.
<li>Models of lexical decision - managing without an explicit lexicon, cascaded activation 
approaches to modeling reaction times, and the simulation of semantic, associative and 
morphological priming.
<li>Understanding the internal representations of trained neural networks - analysis of
hidden unit activations using principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis,
multi-dimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, and output weight projections.
<li>Neural network performance with noisy and ambiguous data - mixture models, the
multi-target approach, and coping with missing context information.
<li>Time series prediction - neural network based systems, temporal representations,
"rocket science".

<P>I am also an Associate Editor of the

IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems</a>
