    My research interests lie in the field of Human Computer
    Interaction, and involves conducting qualitative studies to
    understand how people use new and emerging technologies in real
    world settings in order to reveal and design for the future. Current
    research interests include understanding the impacts of mobile
    digital technologies on work-life balance and productivity;
    exploring the use of personal informatics tools to promote
    reflection and behaviour change; considering people’s sharing
    behaviours around and through technology; understanding the impacts
    on and potential of mobile technology for small children; and
    understanding the gap between the academic study of HCI and user
    experience (UX) practice and research in industry.<br>
    <br>
    I currently supervise MSc project students on these topics and am
    happy to hear from prospective PhD students with interests in these
    areas.<br>

	abstract = {Reflection on personal experience is described as a means to learn from experience, enable self-development and improve professional practice amongst other things. Recently there has been a move in HCI to explore new ways technology may support us in doing this. However, within this community there is little use made of existing literature to evaluate how well such tools support this reflection. In this paper we present a case study of the development of a ‘levels of reflection’ framework for the purposes of evaluating a wearable digital camera (SenseCam) to support teachers’ and tutors’ reflective practice. The framework enabled us to rate and compare reflection achieved by participants in different situations, and to explore the relationship between the ways images were used by participants and the level of reflection this led to, with implications for designing future SenseCam use to better support teachers’ and tutors’ reflection on experience. Beyond our particular case study, we suggest that the framework and associated methodological approach for rating reflection is of value to those within the HCI community interested in designing for reflection on experience. Rating reflection in this way can enable new tools or techniques for supporting reflection to be explored over time, across similar situations or with adaptations, and to build understandings of how reflection is being most effectively supported – ultimately inspiring the design of future technologies by building up an understanding of the most effective ways of supporting reflection on experience.},
