I am a PhD student under
<a href=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe>Martín Escard&oacute;</a>. Until May 2015, 
<a href=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl>Paul Blain Levy</a> was a co-supervisor.

<p>My research is on univalent type theory and models of Martin-L&ouml;f Type Theory; I'm particularly
interested in the relationship between type theory and other topics in constructive math. At present,
I'm looking specifically at partial functions and computability theory in univalent type theory.
I'm also interested in coalgebras, point-free topology and topos theory; this 
doesn't mean I know anything about them.

<p>Previously, I did a double BSc in <a href="http://science.iit.edu/applied-mathematics">Applied Mathematics</a> and <a href="http://science.iit.edu/computer-science">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://web.iit.edu/"> Illinois Institute of Technology</a>,
followed by the <a href="http://www.ub.edu/masterlogic/2012/index-e.html"> Barcelona Master in Pure and Applied Logic</a> organized by <a href="http://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/">University of Barcelona</a>.
In between, I brewed a lot of coffee.

      <b>Teaching</b><br><br>
      Spring of 2016, I was a TA for Models of Computation.<br>
      Fall of 2015, I was a TA for Functional Programming.<br>
      In the 2014-15 year, I was a tutor for the <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/courses/java/msc/">Java Workshop</a> which is part of <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate-taught/degree_info/msc-cs/">Msc Computer Science</a>.

    <b>Other stuff</b><br><br>
    A few PhD students hold "CARGO", a CAtegories Reading GrOup, which 
    meets on Tuesday at 2:00 in room 245. We have a <a href=https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cargo/>mailing list</a>
    which you are welcome to subscribe to.<br><br>

Sometimes I write <a href="https://infinitecardinals.wordpress.com/">things about math</a>,
or write <a href="http://infinite-cardinals.tumblr.com/">poems and lyric essays</a>. You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/alephomega">twitter</a>.
