<strong> Research </strong>
<P>

I am a member of the security and privacy group and also the theory
group <a
href=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/>. <P>

My research interests include security, applications of
mathematical logic and category theory to computer science, type
theory and its applications to functional programming,  proof
theory and automated theorem proving.<P>

I am one of the investigators of the EPSRC-funded 
project "Verifying Interoperability Requirements in Pervasive
Systems", which is a collaborative project between the Universities of
Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow. <P>

I'm also part of the EPSRC-funded Trust Domain Project, which is a
collaborative project between the Universities of Birmingham,
Aberdeen, Oxford and HP Labs Bristol.

 In April 2004 my monograph 
 <a href=http://www.oup.co.uk/isbn/0-19-852633-4> Reductive Logic and
Proof-search: Proof Theory, Semantics, and Control</a>, which is joint
work with Dvid Pym, was published by Oxford University Press in their
Oxford Logic Guides series.  A list of errata can be found <a
href=reductive-logic-errata.html> here. </a>

<P>
Together with Richard Kaye I organised the annual meeting of the
British Logic Colloquium in Birmingham from 12-14 September 2002.
Details can be found  <a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/blc/blc02">  here. </a> <P>

I am a committee member of the <a
href=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/blc> British Logic Colloquium
</a>. <P>

David Pym, Thomas Streicher and I organised a Dagstuhl-seminar on
Semantic Foundations of Proof search in April 2001. The programme can
be found <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/dag01/programme.html"
> here. </a><P>

I was principal investigator of the EPSRC-grant <A
HREF="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/xslam/xslam.html"> The
eXplicit Linear Abstract Machine</A>. The grant finished on 31 March
2000. A summary of the achievements can be found <a
href=xslam_summary.ps.gz> here. </a>
<P>


<p> The theory group in Birmingham has academic links with  the EU-funded
<A HREF="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/ComputingScience/Research/Logic/TypesWG">TYPES</A>
 and  <A HREF="http://www.md.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Semantics/APPSEM/index.html">
 APPSEM</A> working groups.


<p>

I was one of the local organisers of the 12th European Summer School in
Logic, Language and Information (<a
href=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~esslli> ESSLLI'00) </a> here in
Birmingham.
<p>

Valeria de Paiva, Josef van Gennabith and I organised a Dagstuhl
Seminar on Linear Logic and Applications in August 1999. The
programme, abstracts and slides 
can be found <a
href=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/xslam/dagstuhl/report.html>
here</a>.
<p>

Valeria de Paiva and I are organised a workshop on Logical Abstract
machines, to take place here in Birmingham on 14-16 July. For details
see  <A
HREF="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/xslam/wolam2/wolam2.html">
here </A>.
This workshop was a successor to one with the same title, which took
place in 1998 as part of the <A HREF="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/esslli"> 10th European Summer School on Logic, Language
and Information (ESSLLI) </A> in Saarbruecken. Talks and papers can be found <A
