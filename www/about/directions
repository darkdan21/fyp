          <p>The School of Computer Science is located on the main Edgbaston campus near the
University train station: <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/university/edgbaston-campus-map.pdf">Y9, Yellow Zone on the Edgbaston campus
map</a>.</p>

station is on the train-line with a destination of ‘Longbridge’ or’ Redditch’ –
please look for either of these when looking for the correct train at Birmingham
New Street.  More information regarding travelling by train can be found on the
