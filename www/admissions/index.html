          <p>The School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham offers a full range of degrees in Computer Science, from BSc to MSc and Doctorates (Ph.D.) and has consistently been one of the top ten institutions offering computing in the UK over the last five years.  We are currently 8th for Computer Science in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2017/may/16/university-guide-2018-league-table-for-computer-science-information">The Guardian League Table 2018</a>, and  94% of our students go into graduate employment (Destination of Leavers from Higher Education Survey 2015/16).</p>

<p>91% of our students have expressed overall satisfaction with their course in the <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/lt/nss/results/">National Student Survey 2017</a>, and the University has been awarded a <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/teaching/tef.aspx">Gold rating</a> in the 2016/17 Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).</p>

<p>Our School is also ranked 8th nationally for research quality in the '2014 Research Excellence Framework'.</p>

<h1><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/" title="Undergraduate admissions">Undergraduate Computer Science Degrees</a></h1>

<p>When studying for a first degree, you have a choice among our three-year BSc (Bachelor of Science) degrees in Computer Science, and four-year MEng and MSci programmes.</p>

<h1><a href="/admissions/postgraduate-taught/" title="Postgraduate-taught admissions">MSc (Postgraduate Taught) Degrees</a></h1>

<p>If you already have (or are close to completing) a good first degree, you can apply for one of our postgraduate degree programmes.  Our MScs are taught postgraduate degrees, as they involve lectures and examinations as well as a project and dissertation. Some of them are quite research-oriented, while others teach more practical skills in building software.</p>

<h1><a href="/admissions/postgraduate-research/" title="Postgraduate-research admissions">PhD (Postgraduate Research) Degrees</a></h1>

<p>If you already have (or will soon graduate with) a very good first degree and are interested in pursuing research, you can apply to study for a PhD with us. Admission for doctoral study is in some ways similar to that for a Masters degree, but more individual, as a research area needs to be agreed.</p>

<h1>Careers for our graduates</h1>

<p>The University encourages students to choose a programme to suit their future aspirations. As well as excellent teaching and research, we provide <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/eps/study/undergraduate/computer-science/index.aspx">comprehensive careers support</a> for graduates to enter into the computing and information technology industries. 94* of our students secure a graduate level job in industry after studying with us.</p>
