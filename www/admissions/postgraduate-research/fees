          <p>The University charges an annual fee which includes tuition, examination and graduation, as well as fees payable to the Guild of Students. Fees are usually paid annually in advance at the start of the programme but it is possible for you to pay by instalments providing certain conditions are met. A small charge is made for this service.</p>

<h2>Tuition Fees for PhD Computer Science</h2>

<h3>British and European Union (EU) Students 2018 entry</h3>

<p><strong>Full-time: £4,270 per year</strong><br />
<strong>Part-time: £2,135 per year</strong></p>

<h3>International (non-EU) Students 2018 entry</h3>

<p><strong>Full-time: £20,280 per year</strong></p>

<p>Students who are overseas for fees purposes may normally only register on a full-time basis at the overseas fees rate. The University Council reserves the right to revise fees at any time without previous notice.</p>

<p>An offer of a place at the University cannot be confirmed until evidence that you can pay your tuition fees and support yourself has been produced - for example evidence of a grant award from an awarding body such as a Research Council. If you are a self-financing student, you will be required to sign a statement that you accept your obligation to pay fees and that you will do so when they are due. You will not be permitted to continue your studies if you fail to pay the fees.</p>

<p>The full fees are for the minimum period of normal registration (normally 3 years full time). After that, reduced 'continuation fees' are payable, currently £125 per year.</p>

<h2>Cost of living</h2>

<p>It's important to think about other costs that you will incur whilst studying.  You can find information regarding accommodation, living expenses, equipment and book costs <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/support/moneyadvice/living.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<h2>International Student Calculator</h2>

<p>If you are an international student, you may find the <a href="http://international.studentcalculator.org/">International Student Calculator</a> a useful tool to help you work out how to manage your money and build a budget for living and studying in the UK.</p>

<h2>Postgraduate Funding Database</h2>

<p>You can view further information regarding fees and funding available for postgraduate applicants <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/funding/FundingFilter.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Definition of Home and International Status</h2>

<p>If you are unsure which fee category you fall into, you can find useful information <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/International/students/finance/fees.aspx">here</a> and on <a href="http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/International-Students/Fees--finance/Home-or-Overseas-fees/#">UKISA's website</a>.</p>
