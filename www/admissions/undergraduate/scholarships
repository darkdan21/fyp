          <p>The School of Computer Science offers scholarships for students wishing to study for an undergraduate degree in a Computer Science subject. Scholarships are awarded to students who have, or expect to achieve, excellent academic results and are available to students in the following programmes (<strong>which include Year in Industry and Study Abroad variants</strong>):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/cs">BSc Computer Science</a></li>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/se">MEng Computer Science and Software Engineering</a></li>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/aics">BSc Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science</a></li>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/msci">MSci Computer Science</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note the 'BSc Computer Science with Digital Technology Partnership degree' is not eligible for our School scholarship consideration, as the tuition fees are fully funded and a monthly salary is awarded.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>UK/EU Students</h2>

<p>We offer a number of scholarships worth £3000 for UK/EU applicants, for the first year of study.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for consideration of this scholarship, applicants must hold an offer, have attended an Applicant Visit Day and made Birmingham their Firm choice by 1st August. The Scholarship Committee will meet in mid-August to review all suitable applications, and decisions will be made on content of application and final grades achieved. Successful applicants will be notified via email/post.
(Alternative arrangements will be made for EU students not resident in the UK. These applicants will be contacted directly regarding these arrangements.)</p>

<p><strong>Please note that there are only a limited number of scholarships available, and these are awarded to the students with the best entrance exam results.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>International Students</h2>

<p>We also offer a range of International Scholarships to applicants studying outside the UK/EU.</p>

<p>The following awards are available to all privately funded international students applying for 2018 entry undergraduate programmes:</p>
