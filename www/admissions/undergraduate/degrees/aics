<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Understanding the nature of intelligence is one of the scientific challenges of the 21st century. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating subject in which you build intelligent machines and study the nature of mind. On the engineering side, this field is especially relevant in today's world because of the benefits of making computers perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.</p>

<p>From a scientific viewpoint, artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary field that connects with computing, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, mathematics and linguistics. As a result, this degree programme will give you all the computing skills you need to enter industry, while also allowing you to acquire scientific skills in order to pursue research.</p>

<p>We are one of the leading centres for AI teaching and research in Europe, which enables us to offer an unusually rich and innovative programme for undergraduate study. Students benefit from a dedicated robotics and vision laboratory with state-of-the-art equipment, where practical exercises and projects are completed.</p>

<p>Our curriculum has been designed to give you a thorough education in the fundamentals of computer science in the first two years, whilst allowing you go deeper into specialist artificial intelligence related subjects in your final year.</p>

<h3>First year</h3>

<p>In the first year you gain a firm foundation in programming, plus the principles of data structures and algorithms; artificial intelligence; and relevant logic and mathematics. Our main teaching language is Java, a language widely used in enterprise systems, but you will also learn functional programming, which is a style of programming with a deep connection to logic.</p>

<h3>Second year</h3>

<p>In the second year you move on to study enabling technologies and their application. You will learn about a wide range of subjects from the mathematics for modelling and decision making which underpins much of modern machine learning, to systems-level programming, networks, and cyber security. Your programming repertoire will be broadened by exposure to the C programming language plus further functional programming. You will also work together with other AI students to develop a large team project using AI techniques such as machine learning or computer vision.</p>

<h3>Third year</h3>

<p>In the final year you are able to take a range of modules on cutting edge AI-specific topics including complex adaptive systems, intelligent robotics, language and cognition and machine learning and intelligent data analysis. You also spend one-third of your time on a final degree project. This includes writing a large piece of software or doing a major piece of research, and brings together all of the AI skills you have acquired.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Teaching and assessment</h2>

<p>Our teaching employs a mixture of lectures, tutorials, exercise classes, practical work, projects, and independent study all aimed at strengthening your understanding by active involvement.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Career opportunities</h2>

<p>AI affects many aspects of commerce and society. It is a key technology in many of todays more innovative applications including banking systems that detect credit card fraud, intelligent agents in computer games, robotic surgery, medical diagnosis and space exploration.
Because of the outstanding international reputation of our Artificial Intelligence and Natural Computation groups, our students enjoy stimulating and lucrative careers. Many of our students are employed by top companies throughout the world in a wide range of industries as well as in the public sector.</p>

<p>You can find out more about employability and our strong links with industry <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/eps/study/undergraduate/computer-science/index.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Examples of AI technologies</h2>

<ul>
<li>Neural networks simulate the work of neurons in the brain</li>
<li>Natural language processing aims to produce computer systems that can understand, translate and communicate in human languages</li>
<li>Theorem provers allow computers to solve mathematical problems and discover new mathematical concepts</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Course Modules</h2>

<p>You can view the modules available in our new 2018 curriculum <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/new-curriculum/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please note: The modules listed on the website for this programme are regularly reviewed to ensure they are up-to-date and informed by the latest research and teaching methods. Unless indicated otherwise, the modules listed for this programme are for students starting in 2018. On rare occasions, we may need to make unexpected changes to compulsory modules after that date; in this event we will contact offer holders as soon as possible to inform or consult them as appropriate.</p>
