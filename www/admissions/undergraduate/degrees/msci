<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The MSci in Computer Science is a four year integrated BSc+Masters single honours degree programme. In the first two years, students are taught a solid grounding in fundamental computer science.  There is a wide variety of optional modules to choose from in third year, and a chance to delve even deeper into specialist Masters-level subjects in final year, whilst undertaking a 60 credit project.</p>

<h3>First year</h3>

<p>In the first year you gain a firm foundation in programming, plus the principles of data structures and algorithms; artificial intelligence; and relevant logic and mathematics. Our main teaching language is Java, a language widely used in enterprise systems, but you will also learn functional programming, which is a style of programming with a deep connection to logic.</p>

<h3>Second year</h3>

<p>In the second year you move on to study enabling technologies and their application. You will learn about a wide range of subjects from the mathematics for modelling and decision making which underpins much of modern machine learning, to systems-level programming, networks, and cyber security. Your programming repertoire will be broadened by exposure to the C programming language plus further functional programming. You will also be taught professional software engineering techniques and apply them to develop a large team project in Java such as a multiplayer networked game.</p>

<h3>Third year</h3>

<p>In the third year you have freedom of choice to specialise in particular areas of computer science. The choice available covers computer graphics, computer security and verification, theoretical computer science, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and teaching computer science.  You will also work in a group to design and analyse a large software project.</p>

<h3>Fourth year</h3>

<p>In the final year modules from our range of Masters programmes will be open to you. You will also undertake a much more in-depth project which involves a major software or research element, and brings together all of the computer science skills you have acquired. Your choice of modules alongside your choice of project will allow you to specialise in a field such as computer security, human-computer interaction, theoretical computer science, robotics or natural computation.</p>

<p>On completion of the course, in addition to holding a Masters level qualification, students will be well-equipped for a career as a Computer Science professional. They will also have developed transferable skills in numeracy, problem solving, team-working, general communication, and information technology.</p>

<p><strong>If you are undertaking this degree with a Year in Industry or Study Abroad, your third year will be spent working or studying abroad, whilst your fourth and fifth year will be your final years of study back in Birmingham.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>Teaching and assessment</h2>

<p>Our teaching employs a mixture of lectures, tutorials, exercise classes, practical work, projects, and independent study, all aimed at strengthening your understanding by active involvement.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Career opportunities</h2>

<p>Graduates from this programme gain a higher and more in-depth level of knowledge, which equips you with the ability to specialise in advanced areas of computer science such as; security, HCI and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>We have strong recruitment links with many companies, including technology consultancies such as Accenture and LogicaCMG, and the well-known IT corporations such as Microsoft, Oracle, Hewlett- Packard and IBM. Opportunities also exist in investment banking (working for organisations such as Goldman Sachs), in retail banks and telecommunication companies.</p>

<p>You can find out more about employability and our strong links with industry <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/eps/study/undergraduate/computer-science/index.aspx">here.</a></p>
