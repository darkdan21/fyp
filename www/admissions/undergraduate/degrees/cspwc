<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Computer Science is a dynamic discipline. What began with the curiosity of only a handful of academics has blossomed into a field with an impact on our lives that would have astonished many pioneers. In the past 50 years computers have contributed to numerous advances in almost every field, yet developments still show no sign of slowing.</p>

<p>Computer Science now forms the nucleus of a new mathematical science of information processing and communication. Future changes in computing technology will depend on advances in this science. You will learn about all kinds of computational systems, their theory, design, development and application. This includes programming languages, software engineering, artificial intelligence, operating systems, databases, nature-inspired computation, concurrent computing, robotics and the theory of computation. The degree incorporates concepts from fields as diverse, mathematics, engineering, linguistics and psychology, with an additional focus on business.</p>

<h3>First year</h3>

<p>In the first year you gain a firm foundation in programming, plus the principles of data structures and algorithms; artificial intelligence; and relevant logic and mathematics. Our main teaching language is Java, a language widely used in enterprise systems, but you will also learn functional programming, which is a style of programming with a deep connection to logic. Specific to the Digital Technology Partnership degree, you will also spend some of your time on business-related subjects.</p>

<h3>Second year</h3>

<p>In the second year you move on to study enabling technologies and their application. You will learn about a wide range of subjects from the mathematics for modelling and decision making which underpins much of modern machine learning, to systems-level programming, networks, and cyber security. Your programming repertoire will be broadened by exposure to the C programming language plus further functional programming. You will also be taught professional software engineering techniques and apply them to develop a large team project in Java such as a multiplayer networked game.</p>

<h3>Third year</h3>

<p>In your third year you will undertake a Year in Industry with PwC.</p>

<h3>Fourth year</h3>

<p>In the final year you have freedom of choice to specialise in particular areas of computer science. The choice available covers computer graphics, computer security and verification, theoretical computer science, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and teaching computer science.  You will also take one 20-credit Business module, and spend one-third of your time on a 40-credit final degree project. This includes writing a large piece of software or doing a major piece of research, and brings together all of the computer science skills you have acquired.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Teaching and assessment</h2>

<p>Our teaching employs a mixture of lectures, tutorials, exercise classes, practical work, projects, and independent study all aimed at strengthening your understanding by active involvement.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Career opportunities</h2>

<p>Most of our graduates go directly into employment in the IT or business sectors, with an average of 94% finding full-time employment within six months of graduating.</p>

<p>We have strong recruitment links with many companies, including technology consultancies such as Accenture and LogicaCMG, and the well-known IT corporations such as Microsoft, Oracle, Hewlett- Packard and IBM. Opportunities also exist in investment banking (working for organisations such as Goldman Sachs), in retail banks and telecommunication companies.</p>

<p>You can find out more about employability and our strong links with industry <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/eps/study/undergraduate/computer-science/index.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Course Modules</h2>

<p>You can view the modules available in our new 2018 curriculum <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/new-curriculum/g402/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please note: The modules listed on the website for this programme are regularly reviewed to ensure they are up-to-date and informed by the latest research and teaching methods. Unless indicated otherwise, the modules listed for this programme are for students starting in 2018. On rare occasions, we may need to make unexpected changes to compulsory modules after that date; in this event we will contact offer holders as soon as possible to inform or consult them as appropriate.</p>
