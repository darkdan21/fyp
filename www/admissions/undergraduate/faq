<h2>How much are the tuition fees?</h2>

<p>Information on current undergraduate tuition fees can be found <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/fees/fees.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What courses are available?</h2>

<p>You will have the choice of one of the following six specialist degree programmes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/cs">BSc Computer Science</a></li>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/se">MEng Computer Science and Software Engineering</a></li>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/aics">BSc Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science</a></li>
<li><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/msci">MSci Computer Science</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/cspwc">BSc Computer Science with Digital Technology Partnership - PwC</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of our undergraduate degree programmes are available with a <a href="/admissions/undergraduate/year-in-industry">Year in Industry</a> (with the Digital Technology Partnership students spending their year working for PwC). This is an excellent opportunity to supplement studies with a year working in industry and many of our students go on to work for their year-out employers after graduating.  Both our BSc and MSci Computer Science degrees are also available to take with a <a href="/admissions/undergraduate/year-abroad">Year Abroad</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Can I take Computer Science with another subject?</h2>

<p>Yes, Computer Science related subjects may be combined with another subject. The University currently offers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/maths/maths-computer-science.aspx">BSc/MSci Mathematics and Computer Science</a> (hosted by the School of Mathematics).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Are the courses accredited?</h2>

<p>All our current 2017 computing programmes are accredited by the British Computer Society (BCS), which is the UK professional body for  computing practitioners, and a member of the Engineering Council.  That provides exemption from the professional examinations of the BCS, and BSC Membership is recognised by the Engineering Council as enabling registration as a Chartered Engineer (CEng), an internationally accepted qualification.</p>

<p>We have an exciting new curriculum planned for 2018 entry that will be being put forward for new accreditation.  Find out more information <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/new-curriculum/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What scholarships do you offer?</h2>

<p>The School of Computer Science offers a range of scholarships to both UK/EU students and international students.  Find out more <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/scholarships">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>University Scholarships</h2>

<p>The University of Birmingham also offers a number of other <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/fees/funding/index.aspx">central scholarships</a>.  UK students with a household income of below £36,000 may be eligible for either one of the University’s Chamberlain Awards.  Whatever your circumstances, we encourage you to review what the <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/fees/funding/index.aspx">University offers</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What will I study?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The first and second year is designed so that you can delay your decision about specialisation until your final year. You will study compulsory modules in the first two years, and gain a firm foundation in the principles of algorithms, software and hardware engineering and relevant mathematics. You also learn computer programming in Java - a language widely used.  You will be able to choose from a wide range of optional modules in your final year, with the addition of a final year project.  (Those studying the MSci or MEng will choose from a range of optional modules in third year and optional extended masters-level modules and a final year project in their last year.)  You can find more information on our new curriculum <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/new-curriculum/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/aics">Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science</a> students will also learn about theories of mind, and techniques for generating intelligent behaviour. You experiment with the techniques by implementing them as computer programs, and to this end, learn a major AI programming language.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/degrees/cspwc">BSc Computer Science with Digital Technology Partnership</a> follows the curriculum of our BSc, with the addition of some first year business modules and one in the final year.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Do you offer a Foundation Programme?</h2>

<p>The University offers a <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/fd/physical-sciences-foundation.aspx">Physical Sciences Foundation Year</a> and <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/International/foundation-pathways/pathways/engineering-and-physical-sciences-pathway.aspx">Foundation Pathway</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Home and EU sudents</strong>:  Our <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/fd/physical-sciences-foundation.aspx">Foundation Year</a> is designed for Home/EU students who do not have the recommended qualifications for entry into year one of our computer science programmes. Please <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/fd/physical-sciences-foundation.aspx">click here</a> for further information, eligibility and how to apply.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>International students</strong>:  Our <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/International/foundation-pathways/pathways/engineering-and-physical-sciences-pathway.aspx">Foundation Pathway</a> offers three undergraduate pathways for international students, allowing you to complete a foundation year before entering into a full time undergraduate degree in computer science.

<h1>What is Computer Science at Birmingham like?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I didn't know what to expect when I came to Birmingham, but when I came here everyone was so friendly and there was a real sense of community within Computer Science. There are great lectures, great people and a vibrant campus, I wouldn't want to be studying anywhere else!"</p>
  
  <p>&#45; <strong>Katie MacLachlan, 4th Year BSc Computer Science</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>"On arrival, I was struck by how close-knit and friendly the School felt. Students from all years made me feel welcome, and I was surprised by the enthusiasm of lecturers who are always happy to stop for a chat."</p>
  
  <p>&#45; <strong>George Brighton, 3rd Year, MEng Computer Science and Software Engineering</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>"Computer Science is pioneering and hugely exciting. It gives you the ability to work at a local level, but reach out at a global scale. This is the information age, and as such a very interesting time to study computer science, where the rise of social networks like Twitter, Facebook is ubiquitous in daily life, and every business is becoming increasingly electronic. This University is excellent in terms of career service, employer relationships and extra curricular activities. The staff are the most friendly and intelligent bunch I have ever come across."</p>
  
  <p>&#45; <strong>Atif Hussain, Graduate in MEng Computer Science and Software Engineering with Year in Industry</strong></p>
