    #this is the name of the function that takes two sockets for the receive journey:
        #receive(a,b)
        # a is the recieving socket from the remote server, and b is the sending socket back to the client
    proxy-mutate-send: send 
    #this is similar to the 'proxy-mutate-receive' except for data travelling in the other direction.
