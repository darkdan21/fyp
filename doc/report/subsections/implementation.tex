\section{Implementation Details}
In this section all of the areas of the project that have been talked about in the design section are discussed in detail.

\subsection{Programming Language Choice}
For the project, Python was chosen for a number of reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quick to develop and prototype
    \item Generally Safe
    \item Solid language design and features
    \item Wealth of useful libraries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proxy}
As discussed previously, the proxy creates and maintains two sockets, and acts as a `\texttt{man-in-the-middle}' between them, receiving data from one socket, mutating it with the current mutator, and then passing it on to the second socket. The sockets and remote server are defined in a configuration file, which is verified in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Checking the remote server has a port open and that it replies as expected
    \item Check that the specified mutator functions exist
\end{itemize}
This helps make sure the project is stable.

The Proxy maintains both sockets by storing a buffer each way of data that is ready to send, but not yet sent. When the data is sent, it checks the sockets to make sure it has been sent successfully, and if it has not been, it tears down the sockets and rebuilds them. If the socket cannot come back up for any reason, it terminates the program.
\subsection{Obfuscator}
The Obfuscator is split into three parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generic obfuscation for structured data
    \item Steganography by mutating the order of lists
    \item Steganography by appending whitespace to non-whitespace-sensitive fields
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Generic Obfuscation}
The generic obfuscator that was created as part of the project can be used to take any input and generate an output of any highly structured data which can be defined in the format used by the program.\par
As this is for generating structured data, and in the context of this project, HTML, it is only used on the response side of the program to inject valid HTML into the page that is returned from the webserver.\par
As an example, generating simple mathematical formulae from data is demonstrated below, because it is significantly simpler and less verbose than HTML, however the process is the same.\par
The format defined for simple mathematical equations is as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=pagefile]
op <- x
op <- +
op <- -
op <- /
int <-1
int <-2
int <-3
int <-4
intexp <-%int
intexp <-(%intexp %op %intexp)
*exp <- %intexp %op %intexp
\end{lstlisting}

As can be seen here, the format is defined recursively. A tree representing this format and how it is interpreted can be seen on the next page.
The format is the built up by selecting the top level element which is in this case `\texttt{exp}' (the asterisk is only to mark that it is the top level element).\\
\texttt{exp} can only be represented by \texttt{\%intexp \%op \%intexp}. \\
\texttt{intexp} can be represented by a single integer, \texttt{\%int}, or an expression, \texttt{(\%intexp \%op \%intexp)}.\\
As there are two choices, the first bit in the bitstream will be selected and this will be used to choose between the two possible choices, as demonstrated in the tree on the next page.
When there are more than two choices, multiple bits are used to make the decision, however, when multiple bits are required, the order of the bits is reversed.\\
For example, the ASCII characters `hi' are represented as: `\texttt{01101000 01101001}'.\\
When bits are read from the bitstream, they are consumed least significant bit first, which means the order they are used in is: `\texttt{00010110 10010110}'\\
To start with, we have:\\
\texttt{\%intexp \%op \%intexp}\\
The \texttt{intexp} requires a single bit, which in this case is \texttt{0} as that is the first bit of the input. A \texttt{0} means that the first of the two choices are chosen, resulting in an \texttt{int}. An \texttt{int} requires 2 bits to choose what will represent it and the next two bits of the input are \texttt{00}, again selecting the first option.
Therefore the first int is 1. The next part is the \texttt{op} which also requires two bits, \texttt{10}.\\
The order here is again flipped, which means that a \texttt{+} is chosen.
This continues recursively, and results in the following: 
\texttt{$1 + ((2 - 4) \times 1)$}\newpage
To make this clearer, the recursive tree that is generated by the format above, along with the choices to navigate each branch are defined below:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[-latex ,auto ,node distance =3 cm and 3cm ,on grid,
    semithick, req/.style={color=blue},choice/.style={color=red,font=\small},every tree node/.style={align=center,minimum width=3em},level distance=2cm,block/.style={rectangle,draw=black,thick,text width=5cm}]

\node (intexpopintexp)[below of=exp]{\texttt{\%intexp \%op \%intexp}};
\node (intexp)[below right of=intexpopintexp]{\texttt{intexp}};
\node (recintexp)[below right of=intexp]{\texttt{(\%intexp \%op \%intexp)}};
\begin{scope}[xshift=-5.65cm,yshift=-9cm]
\Tree

\edge[choice] node[left,pos=.8] {\texttt{00}};
	[.\node(1) {\texttt{x}};]

		[.\node(3) {\texttt{3}};]
        \edge[choice] node[right,pos=.8] {\texttt{11}};
		[.\node(4) {\texttt{4}};]
	]
	\end{scope}
\end{scope}
\draw[req] (exp) to[out=-70, in=110] node {} (intexpopintexp);
\draw[req] (intexpopintexp.west) to[bend right,out=-100] node {} (intexp);
\draw[req] (intexpopintexp.east) to[bend left,out=100] node {} (intexp);
\draw[req] (intexpopintexp) to[bend left] node {} (op);
\draw[choice] (intexp.south) to[bend left,out=120,in=-90] node {\texttt{0}} (int.north);
\draw[choice] (intexp.south) to[bend left] node {\texttt{1}} (recintexp);
\draw[req] (recintexp.west) to[bend left,out=90] node {} (intexp);
\draw[req] (recintexp.east) to[bend right,out=-90] node {} (intexp);
\draw[req] (recintexp.south) to[bend right,out=90,in=-100] node {} (op);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The tree is navigated until either the input is exhausted, which means the stream is considered a stream of 0's, or the tree is completed, in which case a new tree is started.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Appending Whitespace}
Appending whitespace to whitespace insensitive fields is a simple way to insert more data into the header of the HTTP request, because as in previous sections it is assumed that if the traffic was being inspected, it would be sanitised before inspection. \\
Whitespace can be added up to a customisable maximum.
The way this works is by utilising `\texttt{unary}', which is where a number is represented by a number of items.
In the project, a maximum of 16 spaces (or 4 bits) is used, for example, 7 spaces out of a maximum of 16 would represent `0111'.

\subsubsection{List Order Shuffling}
HTTP headers are stored as a dictionary, which means that we can reorder them without the remote server, or anyone listening to the traffic, being likely to notice.
In a list of 14 elements for example, there are $\Factorial{14}$ or $87178291200$ different ways to order the list.
This means that there are $\Log[2]{\Factorial{14}}$, which is approximately $36$ bits, or around 4 bytes of data that can be stored.\par
The algorithm devised resembles Quicksort, however instead of comparing two elements to each other, the next bit of a bitstream is used to decide the order.\\
Below is some side-by-side Python to demonstrate this, with the differences highlighted:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\hrule
{\setlength\multicolsep{0pt}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{lstlisting}
def @\colorbox{yellow}{quicksort}@(lst):
    if len (lst) <= 1:
        return lst

    pivot = lst[0]
    lst = lst[1:]
    first = []
    second = []
    for item in lst:
        if @{\colorbox{yellow}{item <= pivot}}@:
            first.append (item)
        else:
            second.append (item)
        return @\colorbox{yellow}{quicksort}@(first)
            +[pivot]
            +@\colorbox{yellow}{quicksort}@(second)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
def @\colorbox{yellow}{shuffle}@ (lst @\colorbox{yellow}{,datasource}@):
    if len (lst) <= 1: 
        return lst 

    pivot = lst[0]
    lst = lst[1:]
    first = []
    second = []
    for item in lst:
        if @{\colorbox{yellow}{datasource.getbit () == 1}}@:
            first.append (item)
        else:
            second.append (item)
        return @\colorbox{yellow}{shuffle}@ (first,@\colorbox{yellow}{datasource}@)
            +[pivot]
            +@\colorbox{yellow}{shuffle}@ (second,@\colorbox{yellow}{datasource}@)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{multicols}}
\hrule
\newpage
An example list could be:\\
`\texttt{A B C D E F G H I J K L M N}'\\
If the datasource defined above is for the word `\texttt{data}' (which in binary is:
\texttt{00100110 10000110 00101110 10000110}*), was input into the function, along with the list defined above, it would be broken down into a tree as follows:\\
{\small *Note that the binary is least significant bit first, rather than the more conventional most significant bit first.}

\vspace{0.5cm}\\
At each node, the first element (marked with a `\texttt{\#}') represents the `pivot' in the quicksort. The binary below each element is for deciding whether the element should go left (\texttt{1}) or right (\texttt{0}).
The binary is put into the tree in a depth first fashion, and in order to get the order of the list back out of the tree, it is traversed in-order.\par
The output from encoding `data' into the order of:\\
`\texttt{A B C D E F G H I J K L M N}' is:\\
'\texttt{G H D J A E K L I N B C F M}'\par
To retrieve the binary data back out from the reordered list is trivial, the tree is just built up, and then the binary can be easily extracted.\par
\vspace{0.3cm}

\newpage
One side effect of building a tree based on binary data is that depending what the data to be encoded is, a different number of bits can be encoded*, which means that different amounts of data would be sent with each request.

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{@{}rllll@{}}
\toprule
Type of data & English Text & Random Data & Binary 0's & Repeated `U's \\ \midrule
Bits Encoded & 482 & 493 & 4851 & 474 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
{\small * The Random data test was run 100 times and this is the average. The English data test was run on different data from Lorem Ipsum 100 times and this is the average. The binary 0's is a repeated binary steam of 0's. The Repeated U's is binary switching between 1 and 0 (the binary representation of U in ASCII is 0b01010101).\\
The data above was encoded into lists of length 100.
}\par
\vspace{0.5cm}
It is notable that English text gets fewer bits encoded than random data, which is very different to typical compression schemes where English text is more compressible. This benefits this application, as the typical data that will be encoded will be more equivalent to random data because it will be compressed or encrypted.

This idea can be applied to HTTP headers, to get data from the client to the server.

\subsection{HTTP Mutator}
The HTTP Mutator is the layer that understands HTTP, and where data can be inserted.
To make this work, the HTTP protocol had to be implemented to a level where every part of it can be manipulated. Using libraries was initially attempted, but the library support was not available for chunked encoding, or modifying requests and forwarding them on.\par
Implementing HTTP was not too difficult, as it is a plaintext protocol that is reasonably well defined, however in order to make it work, all of the different compression types have to be handled. It was decided to strip the compression out rather than spend time implementing lots of variations on the same compression scheme.\par

\subsubsection{Inserting HTML-Encoded Data}
In order to insert HTML-encoded data in a sensible place, there are a some problems to solve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The length of the HTML-encoded data could change
    \item The length of the initial HTML could change
    \item The position of the HTML-encoded data could change
\end{itemize}

The solution used to solve the above issues is twofold.\par
Firstly, the data is encoded with the length appended to the front.
The length is in ASCII, which while being more inefficient from a data-storage perspective, provides a token that allows the program to be certain that, if for a given section of HTML the HTML can be decoded into data, and the data is the same length as expected, that it is in fact the data to be decoded.\par
Secondly, there are only a limited number of places where the data can be inserted. The number of valid insertion points (where HTML can be correctly inserted) is counted, and then a function is executed which generates the following sequence of numbers:
\begin{lstlisting}
1
12
70
376
1992
10524
55573
293432
1549327
8180453
\end{lstlisting}
The last valid insertion point is used to insert the data.
The code used to generate the numbers is:
\begin{lstlisting}
def get_position(length):
    current = 1
    nextnum = 1

    while(nextnum < length):
        current = nextnum
        nextnum += current*1.2+2
        nextnum += nextnum*1.4 + 2
        nextnum = int(nextnum)
    return current
\end{lstlisting}
This sequence was used because it provides a small number of points to test to see if data is present, and it expands exponentially, but starts quite slowly. There was a lot of trial and error to get a sensible function.
Typically a HTML page does not even have \texttt{55,573} `insertion' points, however in testing, pages with up to \texttt{300,000} insertion points were found.\par

HTTP has a feature called chunked encoding which differs from standard HTTP by not sending the length of the entire response, but sending it in chunks, and sending the length of each chunk individually.
More headers can also be sent with each chunk, and the webserver does not have to inform the client when all of the chunks have been sent. All of these complicate the matter of receiving data via chunked encoding.\par
To solve these issues, the program concatenates multiple chunks together before inserting the extra HTML-encoded data inside.

\subsection{HTTP Client}
The HTTP client makes HTTP requests to the server, and data is encoded by changing the order of the headers and appending whitespace, as previously explained.\par
To make the HTTP requests, the Python Requests library is used. When headers are added to the requests created by the requests library, it does not preserve the order they are added in thus the client modifies the fields directly inside the library.\par
HTTP is a response/request protocol, so the client has to poll the server at regular intervals to check to see if the server has any data to return. If the server returns any data encoded into the HTML response, the client waits for a short amount of time before requesting another page. This continues until the server returns no data when the client goes back to polling at regular intervals. The same behavior occurs if the client has any data to send to the server, it makes frequent requests until all of the data has been sent.

\subsection{Complete Data Flow}
In this section, an end to end data flow will be explained by sending short messages in both directions with a direct connection to the TCP sockets exposed by the client and server of the program. All of the data here is present in a Wireshark capture which is submitted as appendix 12.2.
The in this section is on decoding the data, but the process is the same for encoding.
\subsubsection{Configuration}

\texttt{netcat} is used to connect to a listening socket on each computer.\par
\vspace{0.2cm}

The program has been set up as follows on two separate computers:

\begin{center}

\subsubsection{Encoded Whitespace}
The first request with data encoded in it is:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=none,showstringspaces=true,showlines=true,showspaces=false]

\end{lstlisting}
The numbers at the end of each line are the number of spaces.
For the purposes of demonstration, the number of bits transferred in whitespace have been increased, and there are a maximum of 64 spaces per line, which means 6 bits per header.
The first number is \texttt{26}, which is \texttt{11010} in binary.
However, this is only 5 binary digits, and each line represents 6, so a 0 is appended to the start, resulting in: \texttt{011010}. As previously, the binary is transferred as least significant bit first, which means the order is reversed to \texttt{010110}.\\
Therefore, the fully computed binary from appending whitespace is the following:\\
\texttt{010110100101101100111000000100100101101100\\
111000000100100001100000010010110110101001}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsubsection{Reordering of Headers}
In the example above, the headers are out of order, and data is stored in the order of them.
To get the data back out, the list is sorted alphabetically, and the first item is taken to act as a `pivot', which is the \texttt{Accept:} header.
The sorted list is then compared to the original list, and for every element in the sorted list that appears before \texttt{Accept:} a 1 is returned, and if it appears afterwards, a 0.
For the top level, this results in the following binary output: \texttt{1000110010011}, and this is recursed upon on each sub-list (before and after the pivot).
When this has been repeated for all of the sub-lists until the sub-lists are empty, the following data is the result:\\
\texttt{1000110010011100010111000010101000}.\\
This is appended to the start of the previous binary stream, and is half of the data we need for the current data.
\subsubsection{Client Side Result}
The rest of the data is in another request, and is:\\
\texttt{1011001110110011101000011011100110101001\\
1010000100010100000000000000000000000000\\
000000000000000000000000000000000000000}\\
Lots of the data is 0's, and this is because when the whitespace is appended to the headers, if no whitespace is appended, that represents only 0's.
To get the initial data out, we append the current data to the end of this, and then reverse all of it.\\
The first 24 bits of this are \texttt{100011001001110001011100} which is \texttt{:91} in ascii. However, this is backwards, and when it is reversed it tells us that the length is 19. Therefore, to get the full data out, we have to read the next $19 * 8 = 152$ bits.\\
This means that the resulting message is:\par
\texttt{This is a message!}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Data Encoded in HTML}
To encapsulate data in the HTTP response (from the server to the client), data is encoded into the HTML response.

The config file used to generate the HTML to insert into the page is as follows, and the binary value for each choice is appended to end of each line and highlighted (the order may be not as expected, but this is because of the bit-order):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=pagefile]

In the example, the data is inserted into position 70, and below is the first section of this:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML,numbers=none]
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><br><h1>Statement #4</h1><br><div><span><span><h2>Rubber ducks are planning world domination<h2></span></span></div>
<br /><br><div><p>Statement #4</p></div>
<br />
\end{lstlisting}
The lines with just \texttt{<br />} are just the bit \texttt{0}, as defined in the file above.
The next line is slightly more complex.
To calculate the value of it, the `\texttt{leaf}' nodes are replaced with their binary value and the type of node like so:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
%content:0%<br><h1>%text:00%</h1><br><div><span><span><h2>%text:10%<h2></span></span></div>
\end{lstlisting}
The next step is to parse valid patterns, so for example a \texttt{tag} can be a \texttt{<h1>\%text</h1>}, and repeat.\\
Each step is shown below:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
%content:1000000%<br><div><span>%tags:00110010%</span></div>
%content:1000000%<br><div>%tags:00100110010%</div>
%content:1100000011000100110010%
%htmlbody:1100000011000100110010%
\end{lstlisting}
As \texttt{htmlbody} is the top-level, this is the output:\\
\texttt{1100000011000100110010}\\
Adding in the previous 0's, we get:\\
\texttt{00001100000011000100110010}\\
This is only a portion of the data in the request, but the entirety of it is:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none,breaklines=true,breakatwhitespace=false]
000011000000110001001100101011001000001001110110001001100000010000101110000101101001
011011001110001101000000010010010110110011100000010010000110000001000100111010100110
1100111000001110111101100111011011001110101001100111010001010000
\end{lstlisting}
Which when converted to ASCII is:\\
\texttt{0025And this, is a response.}\\
The 4 digit number at the start is the length in bytes of the message that has been sent, and the length is sent in ASCII for the reasons described in the previous section.

\subsubsection*{Note on Binary Reordering}
In the previous sections, there is a lot of reversing the order of bits and bytes which is because in the implementation, the binary byte order is least significant bit first, which is different to the typical use. There is no real reason for this, and no advantages/disadvantages, aside from that it makes it slightly more difficult to explain.
