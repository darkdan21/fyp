\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Programming Language Choice}
For the project, I opted to use Python for a number of reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quick to develop and prototype
    \item Generally Safe
    \item Solid language design and features
\end{itemize}

On top of this, I did not know any python when I started the project, and I wanted to learn something new, which I definitely feel I did.\\
Python also has a wealth of useful libraries.
