\section{Conclusion}
The aims defined in the introduction were:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To hide data in the HTTP requests and responses
    \item For the Server to be able to function as a valid HTTP Server
    \item To be able to communicate between the server and client using only HTTP
    \item To make the traffic look to a casual observer as valid HTTP traffic
\end{enumerate}
As discussed in the testing section, all of these aims have been fulfilled, and it is possible to access services and send data over HTTP.\\
