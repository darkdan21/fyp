\newline
\textit{Problem}: VPN traffic is easy to block, and commonly blocked on free public networks.
\vspace{0.4cm}
\newline
\textit{Solution}: HTTP traffic is rarely blocked, so encoding data into HTTP traffic is one possible way to bypass filtering and blocking on public networks.

\newline
\textit{Conclusion}: It is possible to encode data in such a way that it is difficult to detect that this has been done.\par
