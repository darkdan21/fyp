\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to be able to tunnel data, and by extension operate a VPN over the HTTP protocol. There are multiple reasons why this would want to be done, for example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To access services that are blocked by the current network
    \item To hide the fact that blocked services are being accessed
    \item To maintain privacy regarding services that are being accessed
\end{itemize}

This project enables connections to be made and transmit data only over the HTTP protocol, and provide all of the benefits highlighted above.
