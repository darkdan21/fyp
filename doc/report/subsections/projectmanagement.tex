\section{Project Management}
\subsection{Development Principles}
When developing the project, standard software development meth\-odologies were not followed, because these are not always the most suitable for one person.\par
The approach that was taken is incremental development and testing, so constructing a portion of the project and then testing it along with how it integrates with the previously developed sections.\par
The project was developed in a way that maintains good software engineering principles such as high cohesion and low coupling.\par
Regular meetings were held with the project supervisor to ensure the project was on track.
\subsection{Organisation}
The project was organised by taking regular logs and handwritten notes to keep track of which areas were completed, and where work had to be done.\par
Wakatime (\url{https://wakatime.com/}) was also used to track time spent on the project and track productivity.
\subsection{Version Control}
Git was used to track progress of the project, along with sensible commit messages which were used to track work done.
