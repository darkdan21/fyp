\section{Project Management}
\subsection{Development Principles}
When developing the project, standard software development meth\-odologies were not followed, because these are not suitable for one person because there is no handover, and no concurrent working.
The approach taken is incremental development and testing, which is constructing a portion of the project and then testing it, along with how it integrates with the previously developed sections.\par
The project was developed in a way that maintains good software engineering principles such as high cohesion and low coupling.\par
Regular meetings were held with the project supervisor to ensure the project was on track.
\subsection{Organisation}
The project was organised by taking regular logs and handwritten notes to keep track of which areas were completed, and where work had to be done.\par
Wakatime (\url{https://wakatime.com/}) was also used to track time spent on the project and track productivity.
\subsection{Version Control}
Git was used to track progress of the project, along with sensible commit messages which were used to track work done.
