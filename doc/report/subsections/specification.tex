\section{Specification}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system must allow duplex communication with a remote server and local client
    \item All communication between the user and the server must be encapsulated within the HTTP Protocol
    \item The user must be able to browse websites
    \item The user must be able to connect to a remote server, over SSH for example
    \item The server and client must expose a TCP port which can be used for multiple applications
    \item The server must act as a valid HTTP server serving a valid web page if navigated to
    \item The server must act as a mirror to another HTTP server when serving HTTP to both the client and any other clients that may discover it
    \item The system should not encrypt data traveling over it, data should be assumed to be already encrypted
    \item The client should poll the server for data
    \item When the client or server has data to send, the client should increase the frequency of requests
    \item The system should be able to serve multiple clients at a time without interference
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The extra data encapsulated within the HTTP protocol must be done in such a way that is looks like typical HTTP traffic and is not easy or obvious to spot.
    \item The connection speed must be such that browsing the internet is possible without undue difficulty.
    \item If the connection drops, the server and client must work to re-establish the connection
\end{enumerate}
