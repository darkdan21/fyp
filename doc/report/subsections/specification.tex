\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system must consist of a server and a client
    \item The system must allow asynchronous two way data transfer between the server and the client
    \item The communication between the server and the client must all occur encapsulated within the HTTP protocol
    \item The server must act as a valid HTTP server, if connected to by a standard HTTP client
    \item The system should be able to serve multiple clients at a time without interference
    \item The throughput of the system should be high enough to enable browsing of simple websites
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The extra data encapsulated within the HTTP protocol must be carried out in such a way that is looks like typical HTTP traffic and cannot be spotted by conventional tools
